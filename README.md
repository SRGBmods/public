This branch is 100% unsupported and experimental, if it works for you that's awesome but if not do not ask for support as this an experimental branch and if we need testers for feedback we will announce such things.

Currently exerimental devices:

	* Stream Deck + (Plus) (Corsair spawned this knobby stepchild and it can do 32 FPS)
